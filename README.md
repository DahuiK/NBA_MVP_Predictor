The aim of this project is to develop a Linear Regression model with the ability to forecast the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) for a particular season. Specifically, our model will attempt to estimate the proportion of MVP votes that individual players are expected to receive based off of their statistics in a given season

## NBA Data
